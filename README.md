# Stroke Prediction Project

This repository showcases a data science and machine learning project aimed at predicting strokes based on a dataset. The project involves multiple steps from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

## Project Overview
Stroke prediction is crucial for early intervention and prevention. This project uses a dataset to predict strokes based on various features. The main components of this project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and addressing class imbalance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing feature distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
3. Model Building: Implementing and evaluating various classification models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XG Boost, and MLP Classifier.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy, execution time, and generating confusion matrices to gauge the performance of each model.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stroke-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stroke-prediction`
3. Open and explore the Jupyter Notebook files for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
4. Modify the code and models as needed for your own analysis and use cases.
